  To publish a release on GitHub with a compiled version of MicMac (v1, linux/Windows),
use one the two following methods:
- Create a git tag starting with 'v' and then push it on GitHub
   ( git tag v2.01 ; git push origin --tag )
- Use GitHub Release creation feature with a new tag starting with 'v'

  The release Assets will contain, in addition to the source code, 
two compiled versions of micmac v1 : 
- micmac_linux.tgz.
- micmac_windows.zip
